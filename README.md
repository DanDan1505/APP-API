# App API

## Overview

This is a RESTful API built using PHP that provides endpoints for data management. It includes several core files for handling database connections, creating records, processing requests, and application settings.

## Files

- **`create.php`**: Handles the creation of new records in the database.
- **`req.php`**: Manages incoming requests and serves data based on the specified parameters.
- **`conn.php`**: Establishes a connection to the database.
- **`composer.json`**: Contains metadata for dependencies and autoloading for the PHP project.
- **`index.php`**: The entry point for the API, routing requests to the appropriate handlers.
- **`settings.json`**: Configuration settings for the application, such as API keys and environment variables.
- **`profile`**: This file may contain user profile information or related data (specify if it's a directory or a specific file).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the required Python packages (if applicable) for any Python components used alongside the PHP API.
